### Hi there! I am Aditya Tiwari, a Software Engineer 👋

#### I am self taught programmer and incredibly passionate about competitive programming and problem solving. I love brain storming into those problems that requires logic to solve them, also a curious learner about new technologies.

#### Here's a List of things I am currently keeping myself busy with:
- 🌱 Helping solve local community problems by building <ins>**Web Applications**</ins> that make certain changes and makes people life eaiser.
- 🛠  I’m currently deep diving more into <ins>Web Developement</ins> and it's <ins>Back end technologies</ins>.
- ✍️ I love guiding people and juniors and give seminars, to help them to learn from my past experience.
- 💻 On most evenings, I do Competitive Programming, find me here **[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/aditya_tiw)** and **[CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/adi_4)**.
- 😄 Fun fact: When I am not coding, I binge watch movies and series, so open for discussion and new suggestion. 😉<br>
